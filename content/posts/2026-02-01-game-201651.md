In the world of gaming, the term "cozy" often evokes images of relaxing gameplay and charming visuals. However, some games take this concept and twist it, challenging players to think outside the box. Today, we're diving into three surprising cozy games on Steam that aren't quite what they seem, each offering a unique perspective that transforms your gaming experience.

First up is **Viewfinder**, where you reshape the environment by taking pictures and placing them in the world. This innovative mechanic allows you to create new pathways and explore a beautifully crafted landscape at your own pace. Then there's **Gorogoa**, a BAFTA-winning puzzle game that invites you to manipulate hand-drawn panels to solve intricate puzzles, forcing you to view art in a whole new light. Finally, **Superliminal** takes you on a mind-bending journey through a dream-like world, where changing your perspective is key to solving puzzles. While it may have elements of psychological horror, the game remains a cozy experience without any real threats.

These games remind us that cozy gaming can also be about mental challenges and creative problem-solving. So, are you ready to shift your perspective and explore these unique titles?
