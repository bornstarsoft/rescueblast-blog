In a recent update, BioWare's executive producer Mike Gamble has reassured fans that the next installment of the beloved Mass Effect series is still very much in development.

This commitment comes as a relief to fans who have been eagerly awaiting news since the teaser trailer was released two years ago.

Gamble's message dispels rumors that the project might be in jeopardy, stating, "EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe." With a wealth of content still to explore, including new features and character romances, the team is dedicated to delivering a game that meets the high expectations of its fanbase. As we look forward to more updates, the anticipation for Mass Effect 5 continues to grow. Will it live up to the legacy of its predecessors?
