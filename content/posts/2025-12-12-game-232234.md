The highly anticipated PlayStation 5 exclusive, Saros, has officially been delayed until April 20, 2026, pushing back its original March release date. This news comes as a disappointment to many fans eagerly awaiting the game from the creators of Returnal. However, players who pre-order the Digital Deluxe Edition will get a 48-hour early access, which might soften the blow for some.

Saros promises to deliver a haunting narrative set on the alien planet Carcosa, where players will step into the shoes of Arjun Devraj, a Soltari Enforcer. As the game's director, Gregory Louden, described, Saros aims to be an emotional character study that explores the costs of forging a new future amidst a backdrop of shifting environments and relentless enemies. The gameplay trailer unveiled at The Game Awards has certainly raised the stakes for what players can expect.

As we await the new release date, the question remains: will Saros live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors? With its unique blend of action and storytelling, it has the potential to redefine the gaming experience on the PS5. Stay tuned for more updates as we get closer to the launch date!
