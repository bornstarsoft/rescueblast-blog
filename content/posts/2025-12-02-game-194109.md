Starting today, VGC is launching an exciting Patreon Christmas pledge drive aimed at expanding our festive content like never before. This initiative not only enhances our community engagement but also unlocks a treasure trove of rewards for our supporters. By contributing to [Patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle](https://www.patreon.com/VideoGamesChronicle), you can help fund some of our most-requested future videos, shows, and more, making this holiday season truly special for all of us.

Throughout December, every new, gifted, or upgraded membership will contribute points towards an overall total. As this total increases, well unveil stretch goals that include deep dives into our magazine archives, special guest appearances, and commentary tracks for classic video game movies. If we reach our highest goal, well share plans for a unique celebration of the site and the VGC Podcast. The content unlocked during this drive will be available throughout December and early January, ensuring your festive break is filled with VGC goodness.

This is a fantastic opportunity for our community to come together and support independent games media while enjoying exclusive content. What are you most excited to see from VGC this holiday season?
