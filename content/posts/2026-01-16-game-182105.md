In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will go offline permanently in just one year. The game, which has been a staple in the MMO community, has been pulled from storefronts, marking the end of an era for its dedicated player base. The official shutdown date is set for January 31, 2027, with the game already unavailable for purchase on platforms like Steam and Xbox.

This announcement follows Amazon's decision to pivot away from MMO development, leaving many players reflecting on their experiences in the vibrant world of Aeternum. While players who have previously purchased the game can still download it, they will no longer be able to engage with its content after the shutdown. Amazon Games expressed gratitude towards the community, emphasizing the shared journey in crafting the game's universe.

As we approach this final year, players are encouraged to make the most of their time in New World: Aeternum. Will you embark on one last adventure before the servers go dark? The community's response will undoubtedly shape the legacy of this unique gaming experience.
