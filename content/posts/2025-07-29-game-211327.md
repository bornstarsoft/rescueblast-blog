In a bold move that reflects their evolution, the development team formerly known as No Code has announced their rebranding to Screen Burn. This change signifies not just a new name, but a deeper connection to the essence of their games, which emphasize the nostalgic imperfections of old technology and the lasting impact of storytelling. Founded in Glasgow by Jon McKellan and Omar Khan, the duo has made waves in the gaming industry with titles like Stories Untold and Observation, and they are currently working on the highly anticipated Silent Hill: Townfall.

Jon McKellan, the creative director, articulated the motivation behind this change, stating, "Were not who we were in 2015. Weve grown and changed. For a start, we have coders now!" This statement encapsulates the journey of the team and their commitment to evolving alongside the gaming landscape. The rebranding not only enhances their online presence but also alleviates the SEO challenges they faced with the previous name, which often led to confusion in search results.

As Screen Burn embarks on this new chapter, it raises an intriguing question: how will this fresh identity influence their upcoming projects and the stories they choose to tell?
