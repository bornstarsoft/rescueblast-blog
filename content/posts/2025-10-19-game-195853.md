After two decades of anticipation, the legendary game "Infinity" is finally making its way to the Game Boy Color in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, has been a long-lost gem for retro gaming enthusiasts. With its unique strategic battle system and a captivating narrative, Infinity promises to offer a rich gaming experience that pushes the limits of the classic handheld console.

Originally canceled in 2002 due to market challenges, Infinity resurfaced in 2016 as an unfinished ROM, reigniting interest among fans. The successful crowdfunding campaign led by Incube8 Games in 2021 has now paved the way for its full release, complete with stunning 8-bit graphics and an expansive world to explore. Players will navigate through over 30 areas, engage with 5 playable characters, and uncover a gripping story of conflict and redemption.

As we look forward to the release, the excitement surrounding Infinity highlights the enduring appeal of retro gaming. Will this revival inspire a new generation of gamers to discover the charm of classic titles? Let's keep our eyes peeled for this remarkable comeback in gaming history!
