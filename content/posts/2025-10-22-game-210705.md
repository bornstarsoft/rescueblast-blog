Enigmo, the beloved puzzle game originally launched in 2003, has made a stunning comeback as a 3D spatial experience exclusive to the Samsung Galaxy XR. This innovative remake by Fortell Games invites players to engage with their environment by placing puzzle pieces around their room to manipulate lasers, plasma, and water, ultimately guiding each liquid to its destination. The combination of hand tracking and controller support enhances the immersive experience, making it a standout title for the new headset.

With 50 base levels and a variety of mechanics like teleporters and gravity inverters, Enigmo promises to challenge both new players and seasoned puzzle enthusiasts alike. While currently a timed exclusive, Fortell Games has plans to expand its reach to Meta Quest headsets, signaling a bright future for this spatial puzzler. As we dive deeper into the world of augmented and virtual reality gaming, Enigmo serves as a reminder of how classic games can evolve and adapt to new technologies.
