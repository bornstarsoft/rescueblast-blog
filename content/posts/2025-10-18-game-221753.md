Battlefield 6 is set to enhance player experience with significant tweaks to XP earning and gadget unlocking. According to a recent community update from Battlefield Studios, players can expect a 10% increase in XP gained from completing matches and a whopping 40% boost from daily bonuses. This means that players will start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast, making the grind feel more rewarding.

Additionally, the studio is addressing player concerns regarding the lengthy leveling process for assignments. Career ranks required for certain assignments will now be lowered, allowing players to unlock them at ranks 10, 15, and 20 instead of the previous 20, 23, and 26. While the studio acknowledges the frustrations with the challenges themselves, they are committed to reviewing and improving them in the future.

These changes aim to create a smoother progression experience while still preserving the sense of achievement that comes with mastering weapons. As Battlefield 6 continues to evolve, players can look forward to a more engaging and rewarding gameplay experience. What other changes would you like to see in the game?
