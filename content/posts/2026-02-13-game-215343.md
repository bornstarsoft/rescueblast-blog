Titan Isles, the high-mobility action-adventure shooter from Psytec Games, is set to make its debut on PlayStation VR2 on February 24th, offering gamers an exhilarating experience tailored for the advanced capabilities of the PS5. With a native frame rate of 90fps on the standard PS5 and an impressive 120fps on the PS5 Pro, players can expect stunning visuals and smooth gameplay that fully utilize the console's hardware.

What sets this release apart is the innovative use of the PS5 controller's adaptive triggers, which provide unique resistance for each weapon, enhancing the immersive experience. Additionally, the inclusion of headset haptics and full bHaptics support means that players will feel every action, making the gameplay even more engaging. Having previously reviewed Titan Isles on Meta Quest, we found it to be a standout title in the VR co-op space, and we can't wait to see how it performs on the PS VR2.

As we approach the release date, the excitement is palpable. Will Titan Isles redefine the VR gaming landscape on PlayStation? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: this game is one to watch in 2026.
