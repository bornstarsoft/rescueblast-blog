In an inspiring display of community spirit, a charity quiz has successfully raised over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. This annual event, organized by the charity's North East fundraising group, has become a beloved tradition, drawing teams from across the region to compete in a fun and engaging quiz night, all while supporting a noble cause.

Marie Curie plays a crucial role in providing care and support for individuals living with terminal illnesses and their families. The funds generated from this quiz directly contribute to vital services such as nursing care and hospice support, making a tangible difference in the lives of many. The organizers have expressed their heartfelt gratitude to all participants and local businesses that have contributed prizes, highlighting the collective effort that has made this achievement possible.

As we reflect on the impact of such community-driven initiatives, it prompts us to consider how we can further harness technology and social platforms to amplify charitable efforts. What innovative ideas can we bring to the table to support causes that matter to us?
