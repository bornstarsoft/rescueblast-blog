Gamirror Games is gearing up for the launch of AiliA, a visually stunning mirror-based puzzle game that promises to captivate players with its unique gameplay mechanics and immersive storytelling. Set to release on January 9, 2026, at 15:00 (UTC+8) on Steam, AiliA invites players to explore a world where reality intertwines with its mirrored counterpart, challenging them to think creatively and spatially.

In AiliA, players step into the shoes of Aria, a young girl on a quest to rescue her twin sister trapped behind the glass. The game's innovative mechanics allow players to manipulate mirrors to reshape their environment, revealing new pathways and solving intricate puzzles. With over 100 puzzles spread across seven beautifully crafted stages inspired by Eastern aesthetics, AiliA is not just a game; its an adventure that encourages deep exploration and mastery.

Currently, a playable demo is available on Steam, giving players a taste of the enchanting world that awaits. As we anticipate the full release, one can't help but wonder how AiliA will redefine the puzzle genre and what surprises lie within its mirrored depths.
