Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a triumphant return thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This unreleased gem will be available as a fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, and set to launch in 2025. The package includes an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that not only chronicles the games troubled past but also sheds light on Oberths career and the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit history.

The resurrection of Xcavator is more than just a nostalgic trip down memory lane; it highlights the importance of preserving video game history. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundation's archival efforts, this release serves as a reminder of the countless games that never saw the light of day and the stories behind them. As we celebrate this revival, one can't help but wonder what other hidden treasures from the past are waiting to be unearthed in the world of gaming.
