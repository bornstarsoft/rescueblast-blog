In the wake of significant layoffs at Microsoft, Rare is set to unveil exciting developments for Sea of Thieves during its first-ever Community Direct. Scheduled for Thursday at 3 PM UK / 10 AM ET, this event promises insights into the upcoming Seasons and major changes to the Insider Programme. With veteran developers departing following the cancellation of Everwild, fans are eager to see how Rare will navigate this transition and continue to evolve one of its flagship titles.

The Community Direct will feature core team members discussing not just the future of Sea of Thieves, but also a much-anticipated feature that has been in development. This comes at a time when Rare is reeling from the loss of key figures, including Gregg Mayles and Louise OConnor, who have shaped the companys legacy over decades. As Microsoft restructures to enhance agility, the gaming community is left wondering: how will these changes impact Rare's creative direction and the beloved Sea of Thieves franchise?
