In a world where chaos reigns, Myte Interactive's upcoming game, Northgale, offers a refreshing take on exploration and adventure. Players will take to the skies with their kites, guided by the weakened Northwind, as they embark on a quest to restore balance to a fractured land.

As you navigate through the beautifully crafted landscapes, you'll unlock new flight abilities and encounter charming gnomes in need of rescue. Northgale stands out in the indie game scene by blending engaging gameplay with a serene atmosphere, making it a title to watch for those who appreciate both adventure and artistry in gaming.
