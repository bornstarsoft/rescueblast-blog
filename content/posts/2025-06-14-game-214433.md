In a bold move that has sent shockwaves through the gaming community, Microsoft has confirmed that Obsidian Entertainment's highly anticipated sequel, *The Outer Worlds 2*, will launch as the Xbox brand's first game priced at $80. This decision follows Nintendo's controversial pricing strategy with *Mario Kart World*, marking a significant shift in the industry that raises questions about the future of game pricing and consumer expectations.

The announcement was made during the recent Xbox Games Showcase 2025, where a new gameplay trailer and a behind-the-scenes presentation were unveiled. While the game promises to deliver the same satirical commentary on capitalism that its predecessor did, the irony of charging players a premium price for a game that critiques corporate greed is not lost on fans. The backlash has been swift, with many players expressing disbelief and frustration on platforms like Steam and X, questioning the value of the game at such a high price point.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how this pricing strategy affects consumer behavior and the broader market. Will gamers accept this new norm, or will it lead to a pushback against rising costs in the industry? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the conversation around game pricing is far from over.
