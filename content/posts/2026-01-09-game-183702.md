The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Xbox and Obsidian's action RPG, Avowed, is set to make its debut on PlayStation 5 next month. This announcement, made during the New Game Plus showcase, reveals that the PS5 version will launch alongside an anniversary update on February 17, introducing a plethora of new features including a New Game Plus mode, new races, and a Photo Mode. This strategic move aligns with Microsoft's ongoing approach of expanding its game availability across multiple platforms, enhancing accessibility for gamers everywhere.

Originally released on Xbox consoles and PC, Avowed immerses players in the rich fantasy world of Eora, a setting familiar to fans of the Pillars of Eternity franchise. The upcoming anniversary update has been described by Obsidian as a more rounded experience, promising to refine and enrich the gameplay for both new and returning players. With VGC's review praising Avowed as a solid, entertaining RPG, it's clear that this title is poised to capture the attention of a broader audience.

As we look forward to the PS5 release, one can't help but wonder how this expansion will impact the game's community and its reception among PlayStation fans. Will Avowed's new features elevate it to new heights in the RPG genre? Only time will tell.
