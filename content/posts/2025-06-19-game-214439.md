NINES has just unveiled their latest project, Pipeworks Puzzle, and it promises to bring a refreshing twist to the classic tile sliding puzzle genre. Set in a charming construction site, players will step into the shoes of a plumber tasked with arranging disordered pipe pieces to complete intricate blueprints. With its cute visuals and soothing soundtrack, this game is designed to be both engaging and relaxing, making it a perfect fit for puzzle enthusiasts.

The gameplay revolves around a grid-based arena where players can move pipe pieces in cardinal directions to connect them successfully. Adding to the experience is a support character named ‘Boss,’ crafted by the talented PokuriMio, who will guide players from novice to master plumber. This character not only adds depth to the narrative but also enhances the overall gameplay experience, making it more enjoyable and immersive.

Currently, Pipeworks Puzzle can be wishlisted on Steam, and doing so unlocks exciting features like an endless mode, speedrun challenges, and multiplayer battles. A demo is also on the horizon, promising to give players a taste of what’s to come. As we anticipate its release later this year, it’s clear that NINES is committed to creating a unique and engaging puzzle experience that could redefine the genre.

Are you ready to dive into the world of Pipeworks Puzzle and test your plumbing skills? Keep an eye on Steam for updates and prepare for a delightful journey through pipes and puzzles!
