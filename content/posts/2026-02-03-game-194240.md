In an exciting development for football gaming enthusiasts, Netflix is gearing up to release a new FIFA game, led by Julien Merceron, the former chief technology officer at Konami. With Merceron's extensive experience overseeing the Fox Engine, which powered iconic titles like Metal Gear Solid 5 and the Pro Evolution Soccer series, expectations are high for this reimagined FIFA experience. The game is set to launch in time for the 2026 World Cup, promising a fresh take on the beloved franchise.

Delphi Interactive, the studio behind this ambitious project, aims to redefine the FIFA series from the ground up, now that the brand has parted ways with EA Sports. Merceron emphasizes a return to the core principles that made past football games great, focusing on fun and feel to attract a broader audience. With a small, elite team of designers and developers, the studio is poised to deliver a game that resonates with both new players and long-time fans.

As we look forward to this innovative approach to FIFA gaming, one can't help but wonder: will Netflix's foray into gaming redefine how we experience sports titles in the future? The integration of streaming technology and mobile controls could pave the way for a new era in gaming.
