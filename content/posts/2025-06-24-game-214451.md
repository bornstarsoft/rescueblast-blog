In a shocking turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated a mass layoff process that could impact over 100 employees. This news comes on the heels of a troubled launch that has seen the game plagued by technical issues, leading to significant player dissatisfaction and even refunds from PlayStation.

The Edinburgh-based developer has begun a 45-day consultation period, a legal requirement in the UK when planning to lay off 100 or more staff. This suggests that the studio, which employs around 300 people in the UK and an additional 200 overseas, is grappling with serious challenges following the game's release on June 10. The situation mirrors past industry crises, such as the infamous launch of Cyberpunk 2077, highlighting the fragile nature of game development and the high stakes involved.

As the gaming community watches closely, the future of Build a Rocket Boy remains uncertain. Will the studio be able to recover from this setback and restore player confidence, or is this the beginning of a more significant decline in the studio's fortunes? Only time will tell.
