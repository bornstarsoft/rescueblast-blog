Phantom Feline, the free puzzle game that has captured the hearts of many, just received a significant 2.0 update that quadruples its content and enhances gameplay in exciting ways. Developed by Shady Paw and published by the UMBC Game Developers Club, this title allows players to navigate through cleverly designed levels as Shady the Ghost Cat, who can become a shadow but cannot jump. The new update brings a plethora of features, including 24 new levels, Steam Deck compatibility, and a variety of gameplay mechanics that elevate the experience.

Among the standout additions are new challenge modes, Steam achievements, and the introduction of innovative gameplay elements like conveyor belts and pressure pads.
