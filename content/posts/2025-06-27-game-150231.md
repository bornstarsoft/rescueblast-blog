Capcom has unveiled a fresh take on gameplay with its upcoming title, Pragmata, showcasing a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. In a recent live stream, the first gameplay footage revealed players will engage in hacking robots through a mini-game, all while navigating a chaotic environment filled with enemies. This innovative approach promises to keep players on their toes, merging strategic thinking with action-packed sequences.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, Pragmata introduces players to Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, and his android companion, Diana, who intriguingly resembles a human child. This dynamic duo is set against a backdrop of crisis, raising questions about their journey and the challenges they will face. Despite multiple delays since its announcement in June 2020, anticipation continues to build for this original IP from Capcom, known for its blockbuster franchises like Monster Hunter and Resident Evil.

Having experienced a demo, VGC described Pragmata as "unique" and "polished," leaving players eager for more. With Capcom's strong track record in modern gaming, thereâ€™s a palpable sense of excitement about how this title will evolve over its extensive gameplay. Will Pragmata redefine the puzzle-shooting genre and set new standards for immersive gameplay?
