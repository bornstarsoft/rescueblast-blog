Nintendo Switch Online has just made a significant addition to its SNES library, introducing three classic titles, including the first-ever release of the Japanese game Mario & Wario outside of Japan. This addition not only expands the nostalgic offerings for gamers but also highlights Nintendo's commitment to preserving its gaming history.

Mario & Wario, developed by Game Freak before their Pokmon fame, is a unique puzzle platformer that utilizes the Super Famicom Mouse, making it a rare gem that fans have long awaited. Alongside this, the quirky platformer Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and the enhanced fighting game Fatal Fury Special join the lineup, bringing a mix of genres to the classic gaming experience.

As Nintendo continues to revive these beloved titles, one has to wonder: what other hidden gems from the past might we see make their way to modern consoles? The excitement for retro gaming is far from over!
