In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers everywhere, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only highlights the absence of a third installment in the beloved Portal series but also sets high expectations for a game that aims to fill those shoes. With its unique gameplay mechanics and vibrant visuals, ChromaGun 2 is poised to carve out its own niche in the puzzle genre.

ChromaGun 2 invites players into a colorful world where they wield a special gun to manipulate objects by changing their colors. While the game draws comparisons to Portal, particularly in its setting of a corporate testing facility, the puzzle-solving mechanics are reminiscent of titles like Qube. This blend of influences suggests that while ChromaGun 2 may evoke the spirit of Portal, it promises a fresh take on the puzzle experience that could resonate with both fans of the original and newcomers alike.

With the original ChromaGun earning 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its 2016 release, anticipation is building for this sequel. The developers have also created a free demo available on Steam, allowing players to dive into the colorful chaos before the full release. As we look forward to its launch, one can't help but wonder: could ChromaGun 2 be the spark that reignites the puzzle genre in a way that Portal once did?
