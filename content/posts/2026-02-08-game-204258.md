If you're a fan of puzzle games but often find yourself overwhelmed by their complexity, then Botany Manor might just be the perfect fit for you. Currently available for free on the Epic Games Store, this cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene as she explores a Victorian manor in the late 19th century. Unlike other challenging titles like The Witness or Blue Prince, Botany Manor strikes a delightful balance between engaging puzzles and a relaxing atmosphere, making it accessible for casual gamers.

The game's lead developer, Laure De May, emphasizes that the puzzles are designed to be thought-provoking yet not frustratingly difficult. Players can expect to encounter a variety of clues and steps that require observation and creativity rather than sheer intellect. This approach has resonated well with the gaming community, as reflected in the positive reviews on Steam, where players appreciate the game's inviting nature and aesthetic charm.

As we dive deeper into the world of gaming, it's refreshing to see titles like Botany Manor that cater to a broader audience, allowing everyone to enjoy the thrill of puzzle-solving without the pressure of high difficulty. Have you tried Botany Manor yet, and what are your thoughts on the evolving landscape of casual gaming?
