Indie horror game Haus Of Irndrous is currently available for free on Steam, but this offer won't last long! Developed by Yxtopia Studios, this atmospheric title will transition to a paid model starting July 19, 2025. Players have until this date to add the game to their libraries at no cost, making it a must-claim for horror enthusiasts and puzzle lovers alike.

Originally launched in early access in August 2024, Haus Of Irndrous was designed as an episodic experience, with the first chapter intended to be free. However, Yxtopia Studios has decided to implement a price tag of $1.99 for future chapters to support ongoing development and server costs. This shift highlights a growing trend in the gaming industry where developers seek sustainable funding models while still engaging their player base.

As the game evolves, players can look forward to updates that enhance gameplay, including improved enemy AI and performance optimizations. With the current version of Chapter 1: Traces Of The Soul already available, its an exciting time for fans eager to see how the story unfolds. Will you take advantage of this limited-time offer and dive into the chilling world of Haus Of Irndrous?
