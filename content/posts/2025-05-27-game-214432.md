In a bold move that has captured the attention of the gaming community, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only sets high expectations but also taps into the nostalgia of gamers who have long awaited a true sequel to the beloved **Portal 2**. While the comparison to Valve's iconic series is audacious, it highlights the growing trend of indie developers stepping up to fill the gaps left by larger studios.

ChromaGun 2 invites players into a vibrant world where puzzle-solving is achieved through a unique FPS mechanic involving color manipulation. The gameâ€™s setting, reminiscent of Aperture Science, offers a fresh take on the testing chamber concept, albeit with a more voluntary twist. However, the gameplay mechanics seem to align more closely with titles like **Qube** and **Qube 2**, focusing on colored blocks rather than the portals that made Portal famous. This shift could attract a new audience while still appealing to fans of the original series.

With the original **ChromaGun** receiving 'Mostly Positive' reviews since its 2016 release, there's a palpable excitement surrounding this sequel. As Pixel Maniacs continues to innovate within the puzzle genre, one can't help but wonder: could this be the start of a new era for indie puzzle games? Only time will tell, but for now, gamers can get a taste of what's to come with the free demo available on Steam.
