Exciting news for gaming enthusiasts! The beloved multiplayer 3D puzzle game, Fruit Mountain Party, is gearing up for its debut on the Switch 2 and original Switch in spring 2026. Currently available in Early Access on PC, this vibrant game promises to deliver a fun-filled experience with its unique fruit-battling mechanics and engaging multiplayer modes.

Players can look forward to a variety of gameplay options, including heated online battles for up to four players and a competitive single-player mode that ranks scores globally.
