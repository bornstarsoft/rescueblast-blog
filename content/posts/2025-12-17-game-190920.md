November 2025 was a remarkable month for anime-style RPGs in China, with titles like Kuro Games' *Wuthering Waves* and miHoYo's *Zenless Zone Zero* leading the charge in viewership. The Niko Partners China Games & Livestreaming Tracker highlighted that major version updates and anniversary events were key drivers of this surge, showcasing how dynamic content can significantly boost audience engagement. 

*Wuthering Waves* achieved a staggering 36.5 million viewers, a 103% increase from the previous month, thanks to its Version 2.8 preview livestream. Similarly, *Zenless Zone Zero* attracted 30.9 million viewers, up 84% month-over-month, following its own update preview. These figures underline the critical role of platforms like Bilibili in shaping the future of gaming content consumption, particularly among younger audiences who resonate with ACGN culture.

As we look ahead, the success of these RPG titles raises an intriguing question: how will upcoming updates and new releases continue to shape the livestreaming landscape in 2026?
