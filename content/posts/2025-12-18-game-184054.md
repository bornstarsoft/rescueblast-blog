November 2025 marked a significant downturn for the gaming industry, recording the lowest hardware sales in 30 years. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a stark contrast to the 1.4 million sold back in 1995. This decline is shocking, especially considering November is typically a booming month for sales due to Black Friday and holiday shopping.

The average price for new gaming hardware reached an all-time high of $439, which likely deterred many potential buyers. With hardware spending down 27% from last year, it raises questions about the future of console gaming. The PlayStation 5 led sales, but even the best-selling titles like Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 saw a decline in sales compared to previous years.

As we look ahead, the challenge for console manufacturers will be to navigate these economic pressures while finding ways to attract consumers back to physical hardware. Will we see a shift in strategy, or are we witnessing a fundamental change in how gamers engage with their favorite platforms?
