The development team behind the critically acclaimed game *Lies of P* is reaping the rewards of their hard work, having recently surpassed an impressive 3 million cumulative sales across all platforms. This significant achievement not only highlights the game's popularity but also showcases the positive impact of strategic marketing and distribution, particularly through services like Xbox Game Pass. As a result, the team at Round8 Studio and Neowiz are being rewarded with bonuses, additional paid vacation, and even the latest Nintendo Switch 2 consoles.

In a move that underscores the value of employee recognition, each developer will receive a launch bonus of 10 million South Korean won (approximately $7,300) along with two weeks of paid vacation, adding to the already generous 15 days mandated by South Korean law. This kind of incentive not only boosts morale but also fosters a culture of appreciation and motivation within the gaming industry, which is essential for driving creativity and innovation.

Moreover, the recent release of the *Lies of P: Overture* DLC during the Summer Game Fest has further solidified the game's standing in the market, introducing new gameplay dynamics and difficulty levels that cater to a broader audience. As the development team gears up for a sequel, the success of the DLC serves as a promising interlude, paving the way for future expansions in the beloved Soulslike genre.

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how these developments influence the gaming landscape and whether other studios will adopt similar practices to reward their teams. What are your thoughts on the importance of employee recognition in the gaming industry?
