In a recent interview, Yasumi Matsuno, the writer behind the beloved Final Fantasy Tactics, revealed that the upcoming remaster, The Ivalice Chronicles, will feature significant script tweaks. However, these changes are not influenced by modern societal trends or current events. Instead, Matsuno aims to present the charm of the original 1997 PS1 game in a refreshed format, focusing on enhancing the auditory experience with new voice acting.

Matsuno emphasized the importance of adapting the script for a 'listening-first' approach, which allows for a more engaging performance. He acknowledged that while some lines may be rephrased to reflect his growth as a writer, the essence of the original narrative remains intact. This dedication to preserving the original's integrity while modernizing the experience is a testament to the developers' respect for long-time fans.

For those who prefer the classic experience, The Ivalice Chronicles will also offer a 'Classic Version,' merging the graphics and gameplay of the original with the acclaimed War of the Lions translation. This dual approach ensures that both new players and veterans can enjoy the game in their preferred style. As we look forward to its release on September 30th, one can't help but wonder how these updates will resonate with the passionate community that has cherished Final Fantasy Tactics for decades.
