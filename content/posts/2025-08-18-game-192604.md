In a creative effort to address the ongoing issue of the gender pay gap, Mavens has introduced The Balancing Act, a puzzle game designed to engage players in the frustrating reality of Australias 21.8% pay disparity. This innovative workplace training tool not only raises awareness but also encourages conversations around gender equality in the workplace.

The game, which involves removing 22 pieces from a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle, symbolizes the significant gap in earnings between men and women. As participants struggle to complete the puzzle, they experience the imbalance and confusion that many women face daily in their careers. This hands-on approach aims to foster understanding and advocacy for equal pay, making the issue more relatable and pressing.

With supporting materials that clarify the difference between equal pay and the gender pay gap, The Balancing Act serves as a reminder that while strides have been made, there is still much work to be done. How can we leverage such creative tools to spark meaningful change in our workplaces and beyond?
