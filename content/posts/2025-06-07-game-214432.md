Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has officially named its highly anticipated game, previously known as Project Century, as **Stranger Than Heaven**. Set in the intriguing backdrop of Japan in 1915, this new title has gamers buzzing with excitement, although details remain scarce. The studio, renowned for its Like a Dragon and Yakuza series, has left fans speculating whether this will be a fresh entry in the beloved franchise or an entirely new venture.

The announcement was made during the Summer Game Fest, marking a significant moment for the studio that has consistently pushed the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay. Fans are still reeling from the last release, *Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii*, which was described as an amusing but somewhat underwhelming experience. With Ryu Ga Gotoku also working on the next installment of the Virtua Fighter series, the studio is clearly in a creative whirlwind, leaving us eager for whatâ€™s next.

As we look forward to more details about *Stranger Than Heaven*, one can't help but wonder how this new title will fit into the broader narrative universe of Ryu Ga Gotoku. Will it redefine the series or carve out its own unique identity? Only time will tell.
