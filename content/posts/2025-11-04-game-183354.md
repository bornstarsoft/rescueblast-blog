As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the results of the 43rd annual Golden Joystick Awards, two standout titles from Nintendo's Switch 2 library have made waves by being shortlisted for the coveted 'Console Game of the Year' award. Both Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza have not only captured the hearts of players but are also competing against heavyweights like Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Ytei.

The nominations highlight the impressive launch lineup for the Switch 2, showcasing its potential to redefine gaming experiences. Mario Kart World is also in the running for 'Best Multiplayer Game', while Donkey Kong Bananza is recognized for its exceptional audio design. With voting open to the public until the end of the month, fans have the chance to support their favorite titles and hardware, including the Switch 2 and its Pro Controller, which are also nominated for 'Best Gaming Hardware'.

As we await the announcement of the winners on November 20th, it's exciting to see how these nominations reflect the evolving landscape of gaming. Will Nintendo's latest offerings take home the top honors, or will they face stiff competition from other innovative titles? Only time will tell!
