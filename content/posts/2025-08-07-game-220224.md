In a recent Q&A session, Sony's CFO Lin Tao revealed that the highly anticipated game Marathon is expected to launch by the end of March 2026. This announcement comes after the game's official delay, with Tao emphasizing that while they are working to resolve existing issues, no formal commitment to a release date has been made yet. The ongoing development modifications are aimed at ensuring the game meets player expectations and reflects the passion of its community.

Furthermore, Tao discussed the evolving relationship between Sony and Bungie, indicating a shift towards greater integration of Bungie into PlayStation Studios. Initially, Bungie was granted a high degree of independence post-acquisition, but as structural reforms take place, that independence is becoming lighter. This strategic move aims to unify Bungie's creative output with PlayStation's broader vision, potentially enhancing the gaming experience for fans.

As we look forward to the launch of Marathon, it raises questions about how Bungie's integration will influence future titles and the overall direction of PlayStation Studios. Will this lead to a new era of gaming innovation under the Sony umbrella? Only time will tell.
